Since Connection and Person are now 2 separate micro services, 
Connection needs to use message passing to fetch Person data from its database. 
PersonLookup service is the conduit. It caches person data from Person first and 
then serves them out on demand using gRPC protocol which has a higher performance than REST and 
can be multithreaded for better scalability.
