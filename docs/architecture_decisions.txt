I have built three additional services to support this objective. Location data from mobile devices are ingested by 
the Visit REST API endpoint and routed to the Kafka server asynchronously so users would not have to wait for the 
time-consuming data persisting process to complete in the database.  Kafka has the capability to scale up to several GB/sec bandwidth 
and incur less than 30 ms latency therefore justifying its use for processing large volume of data. 
LocationService persists location data  in PostgresSQL through a post REST call to the Connection endpoint in the order 
they are consumed from Kafka. 

Effectively, we are using Kafka to hide the latency and contention caused by database insert operations.
